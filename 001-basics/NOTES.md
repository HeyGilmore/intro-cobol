## Notes to Myself (Learning Log)

- COBOL uses `PIC` to define how data looks and behaves.
  - Example: `PIC 9(4)` = 4-digit number with leading zeros.
  - Example: `PIC ZZZ9` = 4-digit number but hides leading zeros when displayed.
- Periods (`.`) matter:
  - I’m currently ending each data definition and each statement with a period to keep things simple.
- I’m writing in **free-format COBOL**, so I don’t have to worry about strict column rules from old mainframe style.
